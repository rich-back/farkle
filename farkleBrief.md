# farkle

**Project Title**: React Native Dice Game

**Description**: An iOS first, mobile app based on the dice game farkle

**Why?**: Would like to learn how React Native works, and get an opportunity to link Java and JavaScript/TypeScript

**MVP**: 

* A user can play a single player game, based on Farkle, that works in an emulator.
* The player's score should be updated as they play, and be saveable.
* The app should have full documentation, and be fully tested.

**Extensions**

* A user can play "against" the computer, in a turn-based fashion.
* Best score and leaderboard functionality.
* Sound effects.
* Shake functionality - use a shaking motion to "roll" dice.
* Choice of skins for game's graphics.
* Make cross-platform compatible.

**Risks**

* Need to learn React Native, but have researched and performed brief trials.
* Would like to implement TypeScript, but will fallback to JavaScript if this becomes an issue.

**Exclusions**

* Does not need to run on a web browser (mobile-only)

**Prerequisites**

* Setting up a React Native development environment.
